# Wordlists
Repository with the wordlists I am currently using and maintaining. They are based of [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), [Assetnote](https://wordlists.assetnote.io/) and other sources.
Some of them are an exact copy, others have slight modifications, others are a combination of multiple sources and others are just a shorter version of those.
